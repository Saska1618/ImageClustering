**Link:** [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9446994?denied=)  

### Summary  
This study introduces an Adversarial Clustering System (ACS) for unsupervised labeling of fine art paintings. The ACS combines adversarial learning with clustering techniques to refine label assignments iteratively. The proposed method outperforms traditional k-means clustering by leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn discriminative features. Experimental results on the WikiArt dataset demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness in identifying art styles without human-labeled data.

## 3. Art Style Classification with Self-Trained Ensemble of AutoEncoding Transformations  
**Link:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03377)  

### Summary  
This paper presents a novel approach for art style classification using a self-trained ensemble of autoencoding transformations (EnAET). The method applies spatial and non-spatial transformations to images to learn robust feature representations in a self-supervised manner. By training an ensemble of autoencoders, the model captures intricate artistic variations while reducing reliance on labeled data. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WikiArt dataset and demonstrates its potential in recognizing complex artistic styles.
